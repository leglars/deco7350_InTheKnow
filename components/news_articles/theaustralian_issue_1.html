        <p>US basketball and reality TV star Lamar Odom is fighting for life in hospital after he was found unconscious at a brothel.</p>

        <p>NYE County Sheriff Sharon A Wehrly says the department got an emergency call on Tuesday for an unresponsive man at the Love Ranch in Crystal, Nevada about 112km outside of Las Vegas.</p>

        <p>The sheriff's statement says Odom was stabilised and taken to Desert View Hospital in nearby Pahrump.</p>

        <p>Paramedics wanted to airlift him to a Las Vegas hospital, but he was too tall for the helicopter and was driven by ambulance.</p>

        <p>There was no further word on his condition.</p>

        <p>Sources told TMZ.com that Odom arrived at the infamous brothel on Saturday and had been partying with women "for days" before he was found.</p>

        <p>Brothel owner Dennis Hof told TheWrap.com that Odom's condition was "not good".</p>

        <p>Odom, 35, retired from the NBA in 2013 and was featured on reality TV during his four-year marriage to Khloe Kardashian.</p>

        <p>Kardashian filed for divorce in December, 2013.</p>

        <p>The former Los Angeles Lakers player has battled substance abuse issues in the past.</p>
