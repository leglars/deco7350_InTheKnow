        <h2>14 October 2015</h2>

        <p>Lamar Odom, who won two NBA championships while a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, has been hospitalized in Las Vegas, the Nye County Sheriff's Office announced.</p>
        <p>Odom, also known for having been married to reality star Khloe Kardashian, was found unresponsive at the Love Ranch in Crystal, Nevada, on Tuesday afternoon. He was transported from the legal brothel to Desert View Hospital in Pahrump.</p>
        <p>Odom, 35, was treated by doctors, then transferred to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, about 60 miles from Pahrump. Authorities originally had planned to fly him on a helicopter, but said the 6-foot-10 Odom wouldn't fit.</p>
        <p>Authorities didn't release his condition.</p>
        <p>"We are aware of the reports but have no information to share at this time," Lakers spokesman John Black said. "I am not aware of any of our players being in contact with Lamar."</p>
        <p>Odom was married to Kardashian in 2009 and the two had their own show, "Khloe & Lamar," which lasted two seasons and 20 episodes. Kardashian filed for divorce in 2013, and two years later the couple signed divorce papers.</p>
        <p>Odom played for four teams during his 14 seasons in the NBA and was the Sixth Man of the Year for the 2010-11 season. Odom was drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers in 1999. He played four seasons there before signing with the Miami Heat. He was traded after one season to the Lakers along with several other players for Shaquille O'Neal.</p>
        <p>He was a key part of the Lakers championship teams in 2009 and 2010.</p>
        <p>He was traded to the Dallas Mavericks during December 2011 and six months later was dealt to the Clippers.</p>
